# YT-DL
Simple but powerfull TUI client used to download YouTube videos for Windows...

## Functions
- Download Youtube videos
- Choose resolution and format
- Download entier playlist
- Download only audio
- Unlimited video length and size

## Dependences
**Dependencies:** yt_dlp, FFmpeg
_(all dependencies are included in main release by default)_

**Recommended Python version: 3.10+**



### [**yt-dlp**](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
##
Installation using PIP:
`pip install yt_dlp`


### [**FFmpeg**](https://ffmpeg.org/)
##
FFmpeg is technically not required, but it's highly recommended. **Without FFmpeg, you won't be able to download videos with audio!**
###
Installation using PIP:
`pip install ffmpeg`
`pip install ffmpeg-python`

It's important to run the program directly from the command line using `python ytdl.py` or `python3 ytdl.py`. Without that FFmpeg won't work properly!
