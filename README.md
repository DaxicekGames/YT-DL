##
Installation using PIP:
`pip install yt_dlp`


### [**FFmpeg**](https://ffmpeg.org/)

FFmpeg is technically not required, but it's highly recommended. **Without FFmpeg, you won't be able to download videos with audio!**

If you are **experiencing issues** with FFmpeg, try **running the program directly from command line** using `python ytdl.py` or `python3 ytdl.py` in the directory with your program and not by double clicking the file.
