##
### [**yt-dlp**](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
Installation using PIP:
`pip install yt_dlp`


##
### [**FFmpeg**](https://ffmpeg.org/)
FFmpeg is technically not required, but it's highly recommended. **Without FFmpeg, you won't be able to download videos with audio!**
###
Installation using PIP:
`pip install ffmpeg` and
`pip install ffmpeg-python`

It's important to run the program using "RUN.bat" or directly from the command line using `python ytdl.py` or `python3 ytdl.py`. Without that FFmpeg won't work properly!
